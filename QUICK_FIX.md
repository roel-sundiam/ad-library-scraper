# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix for Angular Compilation Errors

## The Issues:
1. NG2008: Could not find template file
2. NG6001: Component not recognized as Angular component

## Step-by-Step Fix:

### 1. Stop the Angular Dev Server
In your PowerShell window running the frontend:
- Press **Ctrl + C** to stop the server

### 2. Clear Angular Cache
```powershell
cd C:\Projects2\scraper\frontend
```

### 3. Delete Build Cache
```powershell
# Delete the Angular cache and node_modules (if needed)
Remove-Item -Path ".angular", "dist" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### 4. Restart the Development Server
```powershell
npm start
```

## Alternative Quick Fix:
If the above doesn't work, try:

```powershell
# Force restart with cache clear
ng serve --delete-output-path
```

## What I Fixed:
âœ… Added missing `MatRadioModule` to SharedModule for radio buttons
âœ… Verified all component files are in correct locations
âœ… Confirmed component decorator and imports are correct

## Expected Result:
After restarting, you should see:
- âœ… No compilation errors
- âœ… Scraping page loads without issues
- âœ… Professional form with platform selection
- âœ… All Material Design components working

## If Still Not Working:
Let me know and I can create a simpler version of the component to get you testing quickly!

The compilation errors are likely just Angular's cache getting confused about the file locations. A simple restart should fix it! ðŸš€
